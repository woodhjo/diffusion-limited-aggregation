# diffusion-limited-aggregation

Code to simulate the diffusion limited aggregation of particles under different conditions including sticking probabilities, different seeds and restrictions on the movement of the particles (NSEW or NSEW + NW NE SW SE). This was my final project for a module I took in my third year in university.
